Main Menu:
    - Username
    - Multiplayer (can't press if no username)
        - Create lobby
            - Put in name lobby's name
        - Join lobby (lobbies are in a list. double click or select and press "join lobby" to join)
            - Username can't already be in lobby
    - Options
        - Keybinds. Do I even need this? Or even options as a whole?
    - Exit

Options:
    - Keybinds?
        - What keybinds do I need? Should I have keybinds like "up", "down", "jump", etc. that all games use, instead of having their own keybinds?
            - Would that work for games that use, like, "up"="w", then others with "jump"="w", then others with "jump"="space"
                - Just don't do "jump"="w", dumbo
                    - OR have game-specific keybinds
                        - That's gross no

Multiplayer menu:
    - Lobbies list
        (shows username, lobby name, maybe a picture of the selected game)
                                      - Make a shared asset with all games + their pictures & all that
    - Join button (greyed out when lobby not selected)
    - Refresh button (or do you just want to live refresh?) (could also do both) (also have to refresh lobby name, etc.)
        - When a change is made/saved, send it to the server. When the server receives a change, send it to all clients
    - Create lobby button

Create lobby button:
    - Creates a lobby with default name (i.e. New Lobby) and instantly sends user into it
    - Lobbies can have duplicate names, you can differentiate them by the person who made them

    - Do I want a private/public button? Or a password?
    - If I do want that, I'll make sure to add a case for if a lobby goes private but you haven't refreshed yet and can thus still see it.
    - Any changes will be sent straight to the server.

Lobby menu (as owner):
    - Change game
        - Maybe show an image of the game that you can click that takes to you a menu?
    - When a game has custom settings, either have a button that opens up a menu to change them, or show them in a (previously blank) area below.
    - Show a list of all players
    - Have a section for lobby-specific settings
        - When a game can only have a set number of users, (i.e. a 1v1 game), set max_players and don't let game start until enough people have been kicked out.
            - Still show lobby in list, but don't let anybody join if full.

Lobby menu (as guest):
    - Show game, picture of game, and any extra game info
    - List of all players.
    - Maybe put everything in the same place as in the owner's interface, just settings are unchangeable.
